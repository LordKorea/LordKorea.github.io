        <h3>Usage</h3>
          <p>
            SimpleMacros adds two general key bindings, one for the macro manager (default <strong>F7</strong>) and
            one for switching the active macro group (default <strong>F8</strong>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The macro manager can be used for adding new macros and configuring existing ones.
          </p>
          <img src="./images/editor.png">
          <p>
            The text line above the big text field shows which command you are currently editing.
            Each macro consists of <strong>one or more commands</strong> which are executed in succession when the
            macro is triggered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current command can be changed in the big text field. You can also use <strong>regular chat
            messages</strong> instead of commands which will then be sent to the chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four buttons below the text field can be used for navigating through the macros and
            commands. Clicking the 'Next Macro' or 'Next Command' button while the last macro or command
            is selected will <strong>create a new macro or command</strong>, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a macro contains multiple commands they will be sent in succession. The delay between two consecutive
            commands can be changed with the slider in the middle in steps of 50ms (50ms = 1 tick, 1000ms = 1 second).
          </p>
          <p>
            The key binding for the currently selected macro can be changed by the button on the lower left.
            To set the binding you just have to click on the button and then press the desired hotkey.
            The mod does recognize shift and control as valid hotkey modifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The text field next to the button can be used for assigning a macro group.
            Only global macros (empty group) or macros in the currently selected group can be triggered.
            You can use this for example to disable certain macros on certain servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current macro group can be changed by pressing <strong>F8</strong> though this can be
            changed in the controls screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Commands in a macro can be deleted by leaving them empty (gaps in between two actual commands
            won't be deleted). Macros can be deleted by deleting all their commands. Note that macros and commands
            which qualify for deletion will be deleted on the next restart of the Minecraft client.
          </p>
